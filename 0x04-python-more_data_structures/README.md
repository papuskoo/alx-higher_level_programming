Project 0x04: Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
Overview
This project, part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum, explores the fundamentals of Python programming with a focus on more advanced data structures, specifically sets and dictionaries. The tasks in this project aim to enhance understanding of sets, dictionaries, and related concepts, such as lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter.

Project Details
Name: Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
Author: Guillaume
Weight: 1
Duration: January 9, 2024, 7:00 PM - January 10, 2024, 7:00 PM
Auto QA review: 0.0/139 mandatory & 0.0/48 optional (Altogether: 0.0%)
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, participants are expected to understand and demonstrate the following concepts without the help of external resources:

Why Python programming is awesome
Sets and how to use them
Common methods of sets and how to use them
When to use sets versus lists
Iterating into a set
Dictionaries and how to use them
When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
What is a key in a dictionary
Iterating over a dictionary
Lambda functions
Map, reduce, and filter functions
Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Interpreter/Compiler: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
File Endings: All files should end with a new line
First Line: The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
README.md: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
Coding Style: Code should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
Executable Files: All files must be executable
File Length: The length of files will be tested using wc
Tasks
Task 0: Squared Simple
Objective: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix.
Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
Conditions:
matrix is a 2-dimensional array
Returns a new matrix of the same size
Each value should be the square of the corresponding value in the input
Initial matrix should not be modified
Not allowed to import any module
Allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
Task 1: Search and Replace
Objective: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
Conditions:
my_list is the initial list
search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element
Not allowed to import any module
(Tasks 2 to 9 are similar, focusing on various aspects of sets and dictionaries. Details are provided in the original instructions.)

Task 10: Best Score
Objective: Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary):
Conditions:
All values are only integers
If no score found, return None
Assume all students have a different score
Not allowed to import any module
(Tasks 11 and 12 are additional challenges involving list multiplication and Roman numeral conversion. Details are provided in the original instructions.)

Conclusion
This project provides practical exercises to reinforce understanding of Python data structures, functions, and concepts. Participants are encouraged to solve each task independently to meet the learning objectives. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited, and completion of the tasks is essential for successful project submission.
