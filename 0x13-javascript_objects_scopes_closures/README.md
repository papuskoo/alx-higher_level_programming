Why JavaScript programming is amazing.
How to create an object in JavaScript.
Understanding of this keyword.
Understanding of undefined.
Importance of variable type and scope.

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x).
All files must end with a new line.
The first line of all files must be exactly #!/usr/bin/node.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Code should be semistandard compliant with semicolons at the top (Standard + AirBnB style).
All files must be executable.
Use Node 14 for installation.
Install semistandard globally for coding standards.
Tasks
The project includes several tasks to accomplish, ranging from defining classes to implementing various JavaScript functionalities. The tasks are as follows:

Rectangle #0: Define an empty Rectangle class using the class notation.
Rectangle #1: Create a Rectangle class with width and height attributes initialized in the constructor.
Rectangle #2: Extend Rectangle class to handle cases where width or height is 0 or negative.
Rectangle #3: Implement a print method in Rectangle class to print rectangles using 'X'.
Rectangle #4: Extend Rectangle class with methods to rotate and double the rectangle.
Square #0: Create a Square class inheriting from Rectangle and implementing print and double methods.
Square #1: Extend Square class with a charPrint method that prints using a specified character or 'X' by default.
Occurrences: Write a function to count occurrences in a list.
Esrever: Implement a function to reverse a list without using the built-in reverse method.
Log me: Create a function that logs arguments with their count.
Number conversion: Write a function to convert numbers from base 10 to another base.
Factor index: Import and compute a new array based on the initial list.
Sorted occurrences: Import a dictionary and compute a new dictionary based on occurrences.
Each task has specific requirements and guidelines to follow for successful completion.
