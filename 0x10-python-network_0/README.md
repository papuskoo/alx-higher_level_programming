Project 0x10 - Python Network #0
Overview
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of networking, HTTP, and API interactions using Python and Bash scripting. It covers various tasks including sending HTTP requests, handling responses, and working with different HTTP methods.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:

Understanding of URLs, HTTP, and HTTP methods
Reading and interpreting URLs
Sending HTTP requests and handling responses
Working with HTTP headers and message bodies
Utilizing cURL for making requests
Implementing Bash and Python scripts for network interactions
Project Structure
This project contains several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of networking and scripting. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

Task 0: Writing a Bash script to retrieve the size of the body of an HTTP response.
Task 1: Creating a Bash script to retrieve and display the body of an HTTP response with a 200 status code.
Task 2: Implementing a Bash script to send a DELETE request to a specified URL and display the response body.
Task 3: Developing a Bash script to display all HTTP methods accepted by a server for a given URL.
Task 4: Writing a Bash script to send a GET request with a custom header to a specified URL and display the response body.
Task 5: Creating a Bash script to send a POST request with parameters to a specified URL and display the response body.
Task 6: Implementing a Python function to find a peak in an unsorted list of integers with optimized complexity.
Task 7: Writing a Bash script to send a request to a URL and display only the status code of the response.
Task 8: Developing a Bash script to send a JSON POST request with file contents to a specified URL and display the response body.
Task 9: Creating a Bash script to make a request to a URL that triggers a specific server response.
Requirements
Scripts must be written in Bash or Python.
Bash scripts must be exactly 3 lines long, excluding comments.
Python scripts must adhere to PEP8 style guidelines.
Scripts must be executable and have appropriate shebang lines.
Documentation for modules, classes, and functions must be provided.
Avoiding plagiarism and meeting project objectives without copying others' work is mandatory.
Usage
To execute any script in this project, follow the instructions provided in each task's description. Ensure that you have the required permissions and dependencies installed before running the scripts.

Conclusion
Project 0x10 serves as a foundational learning experience in network programming and scripting. By completing the tasks, you'll enhance your understanding of HTTP, APIs, and scripting techniques, preparing you for more advanced topics in software development and system administration.
