Project Description
The project aims to introduce you to Python programming, covering basic concepts such as printing, string manipulation, and understanding Python's Zen philosophy. It includes a series of tasks that progressively build your Python skills.

Author's Disclaimer
Welcome to the Python world! The initial projects are designed to be simple and straightforward, focusing on core concepts. Don't worry; more advanced and exciting Python tasks will come your way. Python offers various ways to accomplish tasks, similar to C, but with a more flexible syntax.

Remember, Python follows a style guide called PEP8 (formerly known as PyCode). It is analogous to Betty for C. Enjoy the journey!

Tasks
Task 0: Run Python File
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
./0-run
Task 1: Run Inline
Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
./1-run_inline
Task 2: Hello, Print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle")
Task 3: Print Integer
Complete the source code to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by "Battery street," and a new line.

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/python3
number = 98
print(f"{number} Battery street")
Task 4: Print Float
Complete the source code to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/python3
number = 3.14159
print(f"Float: {number:.2f}")
Task 5: Print String
Complete the source code to print the string stored in the variable str three times, followed by its first 9 characters.

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/python3
str = "Holberton School"
print(f"{str}{str}{str}")
print(f"{str[:9]}")
Task 6: Play with Strings
Complete the source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!"

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/python3
