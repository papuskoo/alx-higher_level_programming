Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of error handling. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

Safe list printing: Write a function to safely print elements of a list.
Safe printing of an integers list: Write a function to safely print an integer.
Print and count integers: Write a function to print the first x elements of a list containing only integers.
Integers division with debug: Write a function to divide two integers and print the result.
Divide a list: Write a function to divide element by element two lists.
Raise exception: Write a function to raise a type exception.
Raise a message: Write a function to raise a name exception with a message.
Safe integer print with error message: Write a function to safely print an integer with error handling.
Safe function: Write a function to execute another function safely.
ByteCode -> Python #4: Write a Python function that mimics a given bytecode.
CPython #2: PyFloatObject: Implement C functions to print info about Python lists, bytes, and float objects.
