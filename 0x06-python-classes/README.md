Python Classes and Objects
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to Python classes and objects. The tasks cover various aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including defining classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Background Context
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in programming, and understanding it is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code. This project aims to provide practical exercises to help solidify your understanding of OOP in Python.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

Explain the concept of object-oriented programming and its importance.
Understand the difference between classes and objects/instances.
Define attributes and methods within a class.
Implement encapsulation using private, protected, and public attributes.
Utilize special methods like __init__ for object initialization.
Describe the concepts of data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.
Differentiate between attributes and properties in Python.
Write Pythonic getters and setters.
Dynamically create new attributes for existing instances of a class.
Explore the __dict__ attribute of a class and/or instance.
Understand attribute resolution in Python and how to use the getattr function.
Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
Code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines (use pycodestyle)
All modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation
Documentation should follow Google Style Python Docstrings
No external modules should be imported unless explicitly allowed
Each task should be completed independently, meeting specific requirements outlined in the task descriptions
Tasks Overview
Task 0: Define an empty class Square that represents a square.
Task 1: Extend Square class to include a private instance attribute size.
Task 2: Add size validation to the Square class constructor.
Task 3: Implement a method to calculate the area of the square.
Task 4: Introduce getter and setter methods for the size attribute.
Task 5: Implement a method to print the square using the # character.
Task 6: Extend Square class to include a private instance attribute position, representing the position of the square.
